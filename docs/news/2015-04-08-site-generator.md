First day for the project web site. We are using an home made library called
tonic-site-generator which rely on Jekyll, mdoc and docco to provide a common
theme for all the Tonic suit components. That module is still in development
but the point here is to start using it to make it better.

So be patient, I promise that will be great down the road...
