JavaScript Girder Client is a JavaScript code base that can be used either 
with NodeJS and Browser context.

With NodeJS on top of having the CommonJS module, you also have access to 
a command line interface.

# How to use the command line

- [cli]
- [cli-script]

# How to use the library in a browser

With the Tonic suite, we tend to rely on Webpack to package the set of 
CommonJS modules used for your application into a browser library.

Hence the usage will be similar to the NodeJS code when used on the server side
except a different HTTP library will be used under the cover.
